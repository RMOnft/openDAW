## Header UI Module

Components in this folder render the studio's top header bar, offering quick access to global controls and status.

- **Header** – main container combining menu access, transport controls and screen selection.
- **TransportGroup** – buttons for recording, playing, stopping and looping the project.
- **TimeStateDisplay** – numeric readout for song position, tempo, meter and shuffle amount.
- **CountIn** – animated overlay that counts down beats before recording starts.

Together these pieces give users immediate feedback while navigating or performing.
