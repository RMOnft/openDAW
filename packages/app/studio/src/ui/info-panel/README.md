## Info Panel UI Module

Components in this folder handle editing and previewing project metadata in
openDAW. They include:

- **ProjectInfo** – form for updating a project's name, tags and description.
- **Cover** – widget that displays the project cover image and lets the user
  choose a new one.

Together these pieces provide the "Project Info" panel shown in the studio.
