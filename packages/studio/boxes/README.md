# Studio Boxes

Collection of statically typed box definitions used by the openDAW studio.
These modules describe devices, instruments, effects and other entities within a

[`@opendaw/lib-box`](../../lib/box/README.md).

## Modules

- `device-boxes` – hardware and software device definitions.
- `instrument-boxes` – musical instrument boxes.
- `effect-boxes` – audio effect boxes.
- `midi-boxes` – MIDI related boxes.
- `audio-boxes` – audio file and stream boxes.
- `mixer-boxes` – routing and mixing boxes.
- `workspace-boxes` – workspace state containers.
- `project-boxes` – project level boxes.
- `state-sync` – utilities for synchronizing box state.

Further details and examples can be found in the
[Boxes documentation](../../docs/docs-dev/boxes/overview.md).
