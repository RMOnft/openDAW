openDAW includes a simple notepad for keeping project notes. The panel is
available from the workspace and supports basic
[Markdown](../../../../app/studio/src/ui/Markdown.tsx) formatting.

## Editing

- Toggle edit mode using the pencil button in the corner.
- While editing, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (or
  <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> on macOS) to save your changes.
- Content is limited to 10&nbsp;000 characters. Extra text is truncated
  automatically.

## Persistence

Notes are stored inside the project file and restored the next time you open the
session.
