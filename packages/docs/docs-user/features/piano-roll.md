# Piano Roll

Edit MIDI notes and velocities in a grid-based interface.

## Add and edit notes

- Doubleâ€‘click in the grid to create a note.
- Drag edges to change length and move notes to different pitches or times.

## Velocity and other controllers

Use the lane below the grid to adjust note velocity. Additional lanes can show modulation or pitch bend data.

## Quantization

Select notes and apply quantize to snap them to the grid. Quantize settings are available in the editor toolbar.

## Looping

Drag the loop brace above the grid to repeat a region while editing.

See the [Beat Making workflow](../workflows/beat.md) for a practical example.
