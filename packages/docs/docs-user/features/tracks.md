# Tracks

Manage and organize audio and MIDI clips across your project.

## Track types

- **Audio tracks** record and play back audio clips.
- **Instrument tracks** host devices that generate sound from MIDI clips.

## Basic operations

- Click the **+** button to add a new track.
- Drag track headers to reorder them in the arrangement.
- Double‑click a track name to rename it or press `⌫` to delete the selected track.

## Device chain

Each track carries its own device chain for instruments and effects. Open the **Devices** panel (`D`) to add or reorder modules.

## Automation

Press `A` to reveal automation lanes for volume, pan, or device parameters.

For guidance on balancing tracks see the [Mixing workflow](../workflows/mixing.md).
