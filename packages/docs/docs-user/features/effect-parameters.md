# Effect parameters

Each audio or MIDI effect exposes a set of controls that shape how the signal is processed. Parameters can be tweaked in the device panel or automated over time.

Common examples include:

- **Delay** – delay time, feedback, cross‑feed, filter, wet and dry mix
- **Reverb** – decay, predelay, damping, wet and dry mix
- **Revamp** – multi‑band EQ stages with high/low pass, shelves and bells
- **Stereo Tool** – gain, pan, stereo width, channel invert and swap
- **Pitch** – octave, semitone and cent adjustments
- **Arpeggio** – mode, rate, gate, repeat, octaves and velocity

Hover any control to inspect its value or double‑click to reset it. These controls correspond directly to the processor parameter tables, keeping the user interface and documentation in sync.
