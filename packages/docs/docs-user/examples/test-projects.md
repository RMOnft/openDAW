# Test projects

To try out openDAW features without starting from scratch, load one of the sample
projects in the [`test-files`](../../../../test-files) directory:

- **all-devices.od** – showcases a variety of built‑in devices.
- **eq.dawproject** – demonstrates equaliser configuration.
- **note-regions.dawproject** – contains several note regions on multiple tracks.
- **automation.dawproject** – includes automation lane examples.
- **audio-regions.dawproject** – provides audio region editing samples.
- **bitwig.example.xml** – a tiny Bitwig project useful for import experiments.

These projects are read‑only fixtures; copy them before making changes.
Developers can reuse them in [integration tests](../../docs-dev/testing/integration.md).
