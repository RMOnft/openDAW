# Recording Workflow

Capture audio or MIDI directly onto the timeline.

1. **Choose a track type.** Add an audio or instrument track depending on the
   source you want to record.
2. **Arm the track.** Click the record icon on the track header to enable
   input monitoring.
3. **Select the device.** Use the track's capture panel to pick the desired
   microphone or MIDI device.
4. **Check levels.** Speak or play to ensure the meter responds without
   clipping.
5. **Press record.** Hit the transport record button and perform.
6. **Stop when finished.** The take is placed on the timeline where it can be
   edited like any other clip.

For details on the underlying system see the
[developer capture docs](../../docs-dev/architecture/capture/overview.md).
