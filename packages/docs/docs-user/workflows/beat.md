# Beat Workflow

Follow these steps to lay down a simple drum beat.

1. **Create a new project.** Open the studio and choose _New Project_ from the start screen.
2. **Add a drum track.** Click the `+` button in the track header and pick the built‑in drum instrument.
3. **Open the note editor.** Double‑click the empty clip on the drum track to show the piano roll.
4. **Program a pattern.** Draw kicks on beat 1 and 3, snares on 2 and 4, and eighth‑note hi‑hats across the bar.
5. **Loop and audition.** Set the loop markers around the bar and press play to hear the groove.
6. **Tweak the tempo and swing.** Use the transport controls to adjust BPM or enable shuffle for feel.
7. **Extend the arrangement.** Duplicate the clip or record more variations to build a longer beat.

This workflow gets a basic rhythm going so you can start layering basslines, melodies, and effects.
