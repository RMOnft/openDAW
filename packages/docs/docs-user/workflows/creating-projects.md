# Creating Projects

1. Open the Studio and choose **File → New Project**.
2. Enter a project name when prompted and confirm to create it. The name
   validator accepts 1–64 characters and displays a message if the input is
   invalid.
3. Use the **Project Browser** to manage and switch between saved projects.

Projects are stored locally in your browser. Make sure to export regularly if
you plan to work across devices.
