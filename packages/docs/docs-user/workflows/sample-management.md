# Managing Samples

This guide explains how to organize and edit audio samples within the browser:

1. **Browse** – open the _Samples_ panel and switch between local and cloud libraries.
2. **Preview** – double‑click a sample to start or stop playback. Use the volume slider
   at the bottom to adjust preview loudness.
3. **Edit** – for local samples, use the pencil icon to rename the file or update BPM
   information. Changes are stored locally.
4. **Delete** – select one or more local samples and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> to remove
   them. Samples in use by a project cannot be deleted while offline.
5. **Replace** – if a project references a missing sample, a dialog lets you choose a
   new audio file to take its place.

These tools help keep your library tidy and make it easy to audition sounds before
bringing them into a project.
