# Automation and Modulation Workflow

Control parameters over time for dynamic mixes and expressive sound design.

1. **Choose a target.** Click a track or device parameter you want to change automatically.
2. **Create an automation lane.** Press `A` or use the context menu to reveal automation for the track.
3. **Draw automation points.** Click to add nodes and drag to shape the curve across the timeline.
4. **Add a modulator (optional).** Insert an LFO or envelope in the device chain to modulate parameters continuously.
5. **Map the modulator.** Use the device's mapping controls to connect the LFO/envelope to the desired knob or slider.
6. **Adjust depth and rate.** Tune how strongly and how fast the modulation affects the parameter.
7. **Playback and refine.** Hit play and tweak points or settings until the movement fits the track.

Automation captures precise changes, while modulators add evolving motionâ€”combine both for engaging mixes.
