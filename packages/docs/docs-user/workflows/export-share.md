# Export and Share Workflow

Share your music outside of openDAW by rendering audio or packaging the project.

The diagram shows how data moves from the App through the Studio, Runtime and DSP layers before reaching storage.

1. **Finalize your mix.** Balance tracks and stop playback where you want the export to end.
2. **Open the export dialog.** From the main menu choose _File â†’ Export_.
3. **Pick an option.** Select _Audio Mixdown_ to render a WAV/MP3 or _Project Bundle_ to create an `.odb` file.
4. **Set the range.** Export the entire song or define start and end markers for a section.
5. **Confirm quality settings.** Choose sample rate and format if exporting audio.
6. **Start the export.** Click _Export_ and wait for processing to complete.
7. **Download or share.** Save the resulting file to your computer or send the bundle to a collaborator.

Use this workflow whenever you need to back up a project or deliver a finished track.
