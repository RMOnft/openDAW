# Security

openDAW runs entirely in your browser and stores projects locally. The
application avoids sending your audio or project data to remote servers unless
you choose to share it.

- Use samples and plugins from sources you trust.
- Keep your browser up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.
- When granting microphone or file permissions, ensure the request comes from
  the official openDAW application.

Your work remains on your device, giving you control over how it is shared.
