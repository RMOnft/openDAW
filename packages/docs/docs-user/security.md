# Security

openDAW runs entirely in your browser and stores projects locally. The
application avoids sending your audio or project data to remote servers unless
you choose to share it.

- Use samples and plugins from sources you trust.
- Keep your browser up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.
- When granting microphone or file permissions, ensure the request comes from
  the official openDAW application.
- Serve the application over HTTPS to prevent man‑in‑the‑middle attacks and to
  enable cross‑origin isolation.
- Verify downloads before importing projects or samples from others.
- Exported project bundles contain everything needed to recreate your work;
  store them in a safe location.

Your work remains on your device, giving you control over how it is shared.
