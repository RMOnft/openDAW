# UI Tour

The Studio interface is composed of several panels that can be rearranged to
fit your workflow. Use the workspace header to access transport controls and
open additional tooling such as the mixer or project browser.

The tour walks through the default layout and highlights common entry points
for editing audio, managing devices and browsing samples.

Get oriented with the main areas of the interface.

## Transport

The top bar houses play, stop, record, tempo, and loop controls.

## Track Area

The central arranger where audio and MIDI clips are placed on tracks.

## Browser

The left panel for files, devices, and presets. Toggle it with `B`.

## Editor

## Device Panel

## Mixer
