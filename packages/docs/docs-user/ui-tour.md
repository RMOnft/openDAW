# UI Tour

The Studio interface is composed of several panels that can be rearranged to
fit your workflow. Use the workspace header to access transport controls and
open additional tooling such as the mixer or project browser.

The tour walks through the default layout and highlights common entry points
for editing audio, managing devices and browsing samples.

Get oriented with the main areas of the interface.

## Transport

The top bar houses play, stop, record, tempo, and loop controls.

## Track Area

The central arranger where audio and MIDI clips are placed on tracks.

## Browser

The left panel for files, devices, and presets. Toggle it with `B`.

## Editor

The bottom panel that shows the [Piano Roll](features/piano-roll.md) or audio editor for the selected clip. Toggle with `E`.

## Device Panel

Displays the device chain for the active track, allowing you to add and tweak instruments and effects. Toggle with `D`.

## Mixer

Shows channel strips for each track. Toggle the panel with `M` or switch to the dedicated mixer view via `â‡§2`.

## Surfaces

The interface is built on "surfaces" which wrap each browser window and manage tooltips and flyout layers. Advanced users can open additional windows; see the developer [Surface docs](../docs-dev/ui/surface/overview.md) for details.
