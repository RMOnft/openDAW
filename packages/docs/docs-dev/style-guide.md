# Style Guide

Developers extending openDAW should follow the shared styling rules.

- CSS custom properties use kebab-case, e.g. `--color-blue`.
- Core variables live in [`colors.sass`](../../../packages/app/studio/src/colors.sass).
- Classes, mixins and files are named with hyphens rather than camelCase.
- Asset metadata or comments should link back to the [style guidelines](../../../styles/OpenDAW/style-guidelines.md).

These conventions keep the look of the project consistent and predictable.
