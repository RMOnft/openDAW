# Security & Privacy

openDAW is committed to providing a safe environment for creators. The project avoids user tracking, ads, and data collection by design. When contributing code, please:

- Avoid introducing third-party services that transmit user data.
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- Handle any user-provided files strictly within the browser's sandboxed storage.
- Report security issues privately to the maintainers before disclosing them.

We aim for transparency and minimal data surface so artists can create without compromising privacy.
