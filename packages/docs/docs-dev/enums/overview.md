# Enums Overview

The `@opendaw/studio-enums` package contains enumerations shared across the
project. They provide well-known constants for wiring boxes, describing audio
unit kinds, and configuring signal routing.

## Available enums

- `Pointers` – references to boxes and collections in the graph.
- `AudioSendRouting` – whether a send is tapped pre- or post-fader.
- `AudioUnitType` – categories of audio units such as instruments or outputs.
