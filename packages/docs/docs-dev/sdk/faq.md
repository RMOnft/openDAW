# SDK FAQ

### Do I need the entire SDK?

No. Each interface can be imported separately if you only require a
subset of the functionality.

### How are implementations provided?

The SDK defines TypeScript interfaces only. A runtime implementation is
provided by the environment hosting the studio engine.
