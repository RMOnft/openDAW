# OpenDAW Comprehensive Documentation & Diagramming Plan

## Overview & Documentation Platform

To deliver a professional, accessible documentation site, we propose using a static site generator like Docusaurus (or alternatively MkDocs with a Material theme). This will organize content into clear sections for each audience and provide built-in search and navigation. The documentation will be version-controlled alongside the codebase for easy updates. We will integrate diagramming tools such as Mermaid (for flowcharts, sequence diagrams) and draw.io/Diagrams.net (for architecture and UML diagrams) to visually explain complex concepts. High-level architecture charts and sequence flow diagrams will be created to illustrate how components interact (e.g. audio signal flow, plugin routing, UI state management). All diagrams will be stored in the repo (as markdown or images) to ensure they remain up-to-date with the code. The site structure will have three main sections – Developers, Users, and Learners – each with dedicated content as outlined below.

## Documentation for Developers

1. **Project Overview & Architecture**: Provide an architecture summary describing how openDAW is structured as a web-based DAW. We’ll explain that openDAW is implemented as a TypeScript monorepo with multiple internal packages (managed via Lerna). For example, the code is organized into packages like lib-dsp (digital signal processing utilities), lib-dom/lib-jsx (custom DOM and UI/JSX frameworks), lib-midi (MIDI handling), lib-dawproject (project file format support), etc. We will diagram the high-level architecture: showing how the core engine, audio/MIDI subsystem, UI layer, and file/project management modules interact. A block diagram will illustrate, for instance, how the DSP engine interacts with the browser’s Web Audio API, how the custom UI framework renders the DAW interface, and how data flows between these components. Key design principles (like avoiding external frameworks and using Web Standards) will be noted, since openDAW “tries to avoid external libraries” in favor of in-house solutions.

2. **Core Modules & Unique Subsystems**: Document each major module in depth, with module-level descriptions and class diagrams for complex parts.
   - **Digital Audio Engine (DSP)** – Explain how `@opendaw/lib-dsp` provides fundamental DSP routines (FFT, filters, oscillators, etc.) and audio scheduling. We will list its capabilities (FFT implementations, audio delay, oscillator generators, filters, RMS calculations, etc.) and explain how these are used to build synths and effects. The internal audio graph and event scheduler will be described in detail – including how events (notes, automation) are scheduled and how the audio processing graph is managed. If applicable, we’ll include a flowchart of the audio signal path (e.g. MIDI input → instrument oscillator → effect chain → mixer → output).
   - **MIDI Handling** – Document the MIDI subsystem (`lib-midi`), covering how MIDI messages or files are parsed and routed to instruments. Any integration with the Web MIDI API or custom MIDI file loaders will be noted.
   - **Project Format** – openDAW supports the open DAWproject XML schema for saving sessions. We will document how project files are structured (tracks, clips, automation data, etc.) and how openDAW bundles projects. We’ll explain the custom project bundle format (called “ODB” – a single-file project export) for sharing sessions.
   - **File Storage and Persistence** – openDAW leverages the browser’s Origin Private File System (OPFS) for local storage of samples and projects. We will explain how the app saves assets in the browser sandbox and how it works offline. A diagram will show the data flow for importing a sample (user drags a WAV → stored in OPFS → referenced in the project). We’ll also cover the Web Workers used for background tasks like waveform generation: e.g. `lib-fusion` spawns a worker to calculate audio wave peaks for display. This section will highlight these unique technical solutions (avoiding a server backend by using in-browser storage and workers).
   - **Custom UI Framework** – Document the in-house UI libraries (`lib-dom` and `lib-jsx`). We’ll explain how openDAW avoids frameworks like React by using a lightweight JSX engine and direct DOM manipulation. For instance, `lib-jsx` provides utilities for creating elements and a component system, while `lib-dom` offers helpers for DOM events, SVG drawing, drag-and-drop, keyboard input, etc. We will provide a component hierarchy diagram illustrating the UI structure (e.g. how the Timeline, Mixer, and Device Panel components are composed). Code examples will show how a simple UI component is defined in openDAW’s JSX system.

3. **Detailed API Reference**: For developers extending or embedding openDAW, we will include an API reference of important classes and functions. Using TypeDoc or JSDoc comments from the code, we’ll generate reference pages for modules – for example, documenting the methods in the audio engine (like how to programmatically create a track, add an effect, or respond to transport events). If an SDK package exists (such as `@opendaw/studio-sdk`), we’ll provide guidance on using it. We will also document plugin extension points – e.g., if openDAW supports adding custom “Boxes” (devices), how a developer can create one and integrate it into the system. Any public or semi-public APIs will be clearly listed for developers.

4. **Build & Contribution Guide**: Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a development environment and building openDAW from source. This will include prerequisites (Node.js >= 18, TypeScript, Sass, etc.), then commands to clone the repo and install dependencies. For example, we’ll show the needed commands: `npm run cert` (to generate HTTPS certs), `npm install`, `npm run build`, and how to launch the dev server. Any gotchas (e.g. needing to use `npm run dev:studio` vs. `dev:headless` for different modes) will be explained. We will also explain the repository structure (monorepo packages, what each folder contains) to help new contributors navigate the code. Additionally, guidelines for contributing (code style, how to run tests, submitting pull requests) will be included.

5. **Diagrams & Code Examples**: Throughout the developer docs, we will use diagrams to clarify architecture. For instance, a UML class diagram may illustrate the relationships between core classes (e.g. Track, Clip, AudioNode, Device, Mixer, etc.), and a sequence diagram could show how an action (like pressing play) propagates through the system (UI event -> scheduler -> audio engine). We will also include plenty of code snippets and examples – for instance, showing how an effect “box” is defined in code, or how the `events.ts` scheduling works. These concrete examples will help developers quickly grasp the structure and modify or extend the DAW.

## Documentation for DAW Users (End-Users)

This section will serve as a user manual for musicians and producers using openDAW in the browser. It will be written in a tutorial style with screenshots, step-by-step instructions, and troubleshooting tips, assuming no prior knowledge of openDAW. Key components of the user docs include:

1. **Getting Started & UI Tour**: A quick-start guide will help new users get up and running. We’ll cover how to access openDAW (via the web app URL or PWA install) and set up audio (selecting audio device, configuring latency if applicable). Then we provide a guided tour of the interface: for example, point out the Timeline where audio/MIDI tracks live, the Note Editor (piano roll) for MIDI, and the Device Panel for adding instruments/plugins. We’ll note that the layout will feel familiar to users of traditional DAWs (openDAW’s interface resembles elements of Ableton, Cubase, etc.). Each major UI area will be labeled on a screenshot with callouts describing its function. The goal is to let users “quickly familiarize” themselves with the workspace so they can start creating music immediately.

2. **Tutorial Guides (How-Tos)**: We will provide a series of practical how-to guides for common tasks, written in a stepwise manner. For example: “Creating a Beat with openDAW” – showing how to add a drum track, program a MIDI drum pattern in the note editor, and play it back. “Recording Audio & Using Effects” – how to record audio from a microphone (if the browser supports it), then add a delay or reverb effect (using the Device Panel). “Using MIDI Instruments” – loading a synthesizer or sampler from the built-in devices, writing MIDI notes, and adjusting instrument parameters. “Automation and Modulation” – demonstrating how to use Automation Clips to modulate parameters over time. Each guide will include screenshots of the relevant UI at each step and any tips (e.g. keyboard shortcuts for playback, how to snap to grid, etc.). These guides will cater to typical user goals: composing music, editing audio, mixing, and exporting the final song.

3. **Feature Reference**: In addition to tutorials, we’ll have reference pages for all major features and menus in the DAW. This will be like a traditional user manual, organized by topic: e.g. Tracks and Arrangements (how to add/remove tracks, audio vs MIDI tracks, using the timeline to cut/copy/paste regions), Devices and Plugins (using the built-in synths, effects, the “Modular System” for custom chains, etc.), Mixer and Routing (using the mixer, volume, pan, send/return effects and aux busses), Piano Roll Editor (MIDI editing tools, quantization, looping regions), Automation (drawing automation curves or using automation clips), and File Management (saving projects, exporting audio). Each of these pages will explain the available controls and options, often cross-referencing the how-to guides. For example, the Modular System will be explained: openDAW includes an environment to build custom effect chains or sequencers – we’ll describe how to add modules, connect them, and perhaps give a simple example (this feature is noted as a very exciting aspect of openDAW). Another example is “Discoverable Toys” – we’ll explain what these experimental devices are and how to access them, since they offer creative, non-traditional ways to make music.

4. **Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting**: To support users, we will compile a FAQ and troubleshooting section. Common questions might be “Why can’t I hear any sound?” (with answers like checking the browser permission for audio output, or ensuring the track volume is up, etc.), or “My microphone input isn’t working” (guide them to browser settings to allow mic access). We’ll also list performance tips for the browser (e.g. using Chrome vs Firefox if one has better audio latency, enabling Web Audio features). If the app can work offline as a PWA, we will include instructions for installing the PWA and using openDAW without internet (once that feature is available). Tips may also include workflow improvements, like keyboard shortcuts, or using the weekly Discord meetings for help. Since openDAW is evolving quickly, we’ll ensure the docs highlight the latest features – for instance, newly added features like Project Bundle export, sample import via drag-and-drop, stem-based track creation, and one-click media export will each be documented. We will update troubleshooting info for any known bugs or browser-specific issues, based on community feedback.

5. **Rich Media and Examples**: The user documentation will be enriched with visuals: screenshots for UI explanation and possibly short video GIFs for things like dragging a sample in or adjusting an automation curve (if the platform supports animated images). We will also provide example project files (e.g. a demo song) that users can load to explore a pre-made session. In the docs, we’ll walk through these example projects (“Open the demo project to see an example of a drum beat and bassline – here’s how it’s structured…”). This gives users a hands-on way to learn features by example.

## Documentation for Learners (Educational Content)

A core mission of openDAW is to democratize music production and emphasize education. The Learners section will be geared towards students, educators, or any hobbyists who want to understand concepts behind digital audio workstation technology and music production techniques, using openDAW as a hands-on learning tool. Rather than focusing on how to operate the software, this section will explain the “why” and fundamentals of audio production, with interactive examples in the DAW. Key components of this educational content include:

1. **DAW Basics 101**: Introduce the fundamental concepts of a Digital Audio Workstation in an accessible way. We’ll answer questions like “What is a DAW?” and cover basic terminology: tracks, clips, mixer, timeline, MIDI vs audio, etc. Each concept will be accompanied by a demonstration in openDAW. For instance, to illustrate what a “track” is, we’ll show how adding an Audio Track in openDAW corresponds to a channel in the mixer and a lane in the timeline. We will explain the signal chain in simple terms (audio flows from a track’s instrument or audio clip through effects, then to the mixer, then to the master output). A diagram of a basic signal flow will be used – showing, for example, a virtual instrument generating sound, passing through a reverb effect, then going to the speakers. We’ll leverage openDAW’s own interface to visualize this: the mixer with its send effects and master bus will be screenshot and annotated to show signal routing. By the end of this, a learner should grasp how a DAW internally handles audio/MIDI.

2. **Production Techniques & Exercises**: We will create tutorial-style lessons that teach a music production or audio engineering concept, using openDAW as the practice platform. Each lesson will describe a concept and then walk through doing it in openDAW. For example:
   - “Understanding MIDI and Synthesis” – This lesson explains what MIDI is (a protocol of musical events). It will show how a MIDI clip in openDAW triggers an instrument plugin. We’ll instruct the learner to create a simple melody in the note editor, choose a built-in synthesizer, and experiment with changing waveforms or notes. This ties theory (MIDI messages, sound synthesis) to practical usage (hearing the result in the DAW).
   - “Audio Effects and Signal Chain” – This covers basic effects (EQ, delay, reverb, etc.). We’ll explain the concept of effects and inserts vs sends. Then in openDAW, have the learner add an EQ “box” to a track and play with frequencies, or use an aux send to route multiple tracks to a reverb (demonstrating aux bus sends which openDAW supports). We will also use the Modular System feature to let learners experiment with building a simple effect chain from scratch – reinforcing how audio processing is ordered and combined.
   - “Mixing and Panning” – Teach basics of mixing: volume balance, pan stereo placement, using the mixer in openDAW. The learner can use a multitrack example project provided, and follow instructions to adjust levels and pan, hearing how it creates a stereo image. We’ll explain metering, clipping, and headroom concepts in the context of the openDAW mixer.
   - “Arranging and Song Structure” – A lesson on how to build a song arrangement. It will cover arranging intro/verse/chorus, using the timeline to move around clips, looping sections, etc., teaching musical structure alongside DAW usage.

   Each of these lessons will have explanatory text + a hands-on component (“Try this in openDAW…”). By actively using openDAW while learning theory, users can immediately see/hear the effect of each concept, reinforcing their understanding.

3. **In-Depth: How It Works** – This part is geared towards curious learners who want to peek under the hood of a DAW (could be aspiring audio programmers or just the technically inclined). We’ll leverage openDAW’s open-source nature to explain how audio software works internally in approachable terms. For example, a page on “Audio Signal Path & Latency” can describe how openDAW processes audio in chunks (the concept of buffer size and latency) and why very low latency is challenging on the web (noting that openDAW is designed more for accessibility than ultra-low latency live performance). We can illustrate how an audio thread works, using openDAW’s architecture as an example (showing the separation between the UI thread and audio worklet/worker doing DSP). Another page might be “Digital Audio Concepts” – defining sample rate, bit depth, and using openDAW to demonstrate (e.g., showing how changing a playback rate could alter pitch, or how clipping distortion occurs if we raise gain too high). Additionally, since openDAW includes music theory utilities (notes, chords, fractions in `lib-dsp`), we can incorporate a tutorial on basic music theory: for instance, a piano roll lesson on scales and chords (showing how openDAW might help highlight notes, etc.). This educative content makes openDAW not just a tool to use, but a tool to learn with.

4. **Educational “Toys” and Experiments**: We will highlight openDAW features explicitly designed for learning and experimentation. The docs will explain the “Discoverable Toys” mentioned in openDAW’s materials – these are likely playful, experimental devices in the DAW that encourage exploration (perhaps generative music tools or visual sound generators). We will provide guidance on how to use these toys and what concepts they demonstrate. For example, if there’s a toy that visualizes an audio filter’s effect, we’ll show learners how adjusting it changes the sound and the visualization, thus teaching them about filter curves. Moreover, since openDAW is free and accessible in a browser, educators could use it in classrooms. We’ll include suggestions for classroom use: small projects like “record a short podcast and add background music in openDAW” to teach editing, or “program a simple drum loop” to teach rhythm – all without needing expensive software. This can be accompanied by downloadable lesson plans or links to community-created tutorials.

In summary, the Learners/Educational Section transforms the documentation site into a mini-learning platform for digital audio. It will leverage openDAW’s user-friendly design and web-based accessibility to encourage beginners to learn music production concepts. By combining theory with interactive exercises in the actual DAW, learners can immediately apply concepts, aligning with openDAW’s mission of making music production fun and educational. This section not only teaches how to use openDAW, but also why and when to use certain techniques – empowering users with knowledge that they can carry to any production environment.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

By structuring the documentation into dedicated sections for developers, end-users, and learners, we ensure that each audience finds relevant, targeted information. We will deploy this documentation on a platform like Docusaurus for a polished web experience, with navigation tabs for “Developer Docs,” “User Guide,” and “Learning Hub.” All content will be kept up-to-date with the latest openDAW features, and we will encourage community contributions to the docs (especially for new tutorials or translations, via GitHub). Diagrams and rich media will be used throughout to make the documentation clear and engaging. This comprehensive docs site will support openDAW’s community growth by lowering the barrier to entry for new developers, helping users make music effectively, and teaching newcomers the art and science of digital audio – truly democratizing music production through openness and education.

## Example Project Downloads

We will host downloadable `.odb` demo projects in `packages/docs/static/examples`. These files can be linked from the user docs so readers can import a fully arranged session and explore openDAW features.

## Screenshot and GIF Pipeline

Screenshots and short GIFs will be generated with an automated workflow:

1. Use a headless Chromium script to open the studio at a predefined state and capture high-resolution PNGs.
2. Optimize images with `imagemagick` and convert recordings to GIF using `ffmpeg`.
3. Commit the optimized media under `packages/docs/static/img` so documentation pages can reference them.

This pipeline ensures consistent visuals and keeps asset sizes small.
