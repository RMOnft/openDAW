# Styling

Global styles are in `packages/docs/src/css/custom.css` while component-scoped styles accompany their components such as `packages/docs/src/components/HomepageFeatures/styles.module.css`.

See the [overview](overview.md) for context and the [structure guide](structure.md) for file locations. Contributions should follow the [contributing guide](contributing.md).
