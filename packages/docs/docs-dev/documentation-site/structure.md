# Structure

This guide explains how files are organized.

- The main configuration resides in `packages/docs/docusaurus.config.ts`.
- Sidebar definitions are in `packages/docs/sidebarsDev.js`, `sidebarsUser.js`, and `sidebarsLearn.js`.
- Pages live under `packages/docs/src/pages/` and reusable components under `packages/docs/src/components/`.
