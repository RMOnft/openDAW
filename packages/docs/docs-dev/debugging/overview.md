# Debugging Overview

openDAW provides a set of utilities to help developers diagnose problems during development and in production.

- [Error logging](error-logging.md) describes how runtime issues are captured and reported.
- [Logging helpers](logging.md) covers general purpose utilities such as `LogBuffer` and `stopwatch`.
- [Graph runtime](graph-runtime.md) explains the interactive graph view used to inspect box connections.
