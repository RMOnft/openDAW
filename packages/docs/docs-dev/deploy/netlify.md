# Netlify

The repository includes a `netlify.toml` file showing the typical configuration
for building the documentation site on Netlify. Deployments are disabled by
default but the file serves as a reference for future automation.

- Build command: `npm run docs:build`
- Publish directory: `packages/docs/build`
