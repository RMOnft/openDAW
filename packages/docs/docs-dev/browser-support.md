# Browser Support

openDAW targets modern browsers with full Web Audio and WebAssembly support. The project is regularly tested on:

- **Chrome** (latest stable)
- **Firefox** (latest stable)
- **Safari** on macOS/iOS
- **Edge** (Chromium)

Other evergreen browsers that implement the necessary APIs may work but are not officially supported. Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version for the best experience.
