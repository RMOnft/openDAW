# Icons Overview

The studio ships with a central SVG sprite containing every icon used in the UI.
The [`IconLibrary`](../../../../app/studio/src/ui/IconLibrary.tsx) component injects these symbols into the DOM so they can be referenced anywhere.

For a visual catalogue see the [Icons developer page](../pages/icons.md).
