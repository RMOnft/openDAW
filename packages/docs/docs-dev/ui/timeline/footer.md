# Timeline Footer

The footer row below the timeline tracks hosts navigation controls such as
the range slider. It consists of two components:

- **TracksFooterHeader** – blank spacer aligning the slider with track
  columns.
- **TracksFooter** – container rendering the `TimelineRangeSlider` and a
  background strip.

The footer uses CSS subgrid to match the column layout of the timeline
tracks so the slider lines up with clip lanes.
