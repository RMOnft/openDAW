# Advanced Components

Specialised UI components provide debugging tools and metering utilities that go beyond basic controls.

## Debug Views

- `BoxDebugView` – inspects the fields and pointers of a box.
- `BoxesDebugView` – lists all boxes in a graph with their dependencies.

## Meters

- `PeakMeter` – shows peak levels for multiple channels using SVG.
- `TrackPeakMeter` – canvas based meter with peak hold indicators.

## Misc

- `ControlIndicator`, `InsertMarker`, `FlexSpacer`, and `TextButton` offer small helpers for building interactive layouts.
