## Device panel

The panel displays the device chain of the currently selected track or bus.
Editors are mounted in three sections: MIDI effects, instrument, and audio
effects. Users can reorder devices via drag and drop; the `DevicePanelDragAndDrop`
module coordinates the movement and creation of devices.

The panel also embeds a compact channel strip and meters so that the user can
monitor levels while editing devices.
