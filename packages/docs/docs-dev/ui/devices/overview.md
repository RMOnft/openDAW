## Device editing overview

The device UI exposes editors for instruments, audio effects and utility
modules. Each editor is built on top of a common `DeviceEditor` wrapper and is
hosted inside the device panel. This document provides pointers to the
specialised topics below.

* [Device panel](./panel.md) – how editors are mounted and reordered.
* [Effects](./effects.md) – implementation details for audio and midi effects.
* [Instruments](./instruments.md) – instrument specific editors and helpers.
