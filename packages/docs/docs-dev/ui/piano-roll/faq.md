# Piano Roll FAQ

### Why don't I hear notes when I click on the keyboard?

Ensure that a track with a virtual instrument is armed and that Piano Mode
is not muted.

### How do I change the number of keys shown?

Use the keyboard size control in the Piano Mode panel to select 49, 61, 76
or 88 key layouts.
