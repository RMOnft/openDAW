# Workspace Overview

The workspace system arranges panels into nested layouts described by the `Workspace` namespace. Each screen maps to a tree of `layout` and `panel` nodes that define orientation and sizing constraints.

A default collection of screens is exported as `Workspace.Default`, which developers can extend to provide custom pages.
