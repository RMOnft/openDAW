The studio uses a small set of fonts and utilities to keep text rendering
consistent across browsers. This section outlines the building blocks and how
they interact.

- [`font-loading`](font-loading.md) explains how fonts are registered with the
  browser.
- [`markdown`](markdown.md) describes the Markdown renderer used for manuals and
  the inâ€‘app notepad.
- [`notepad`](notepad.md) covers the editable notes panel available inside the
  workspace.
