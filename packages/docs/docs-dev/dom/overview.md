# DOM Utilities

The `@opendaw/lib-dom` package contains small helpers for working with
browser APIs. It is split into focused modules that can be imported
individually or via the package entrypoint.

- [Events](./events.md)
- [Streams](./streams.md)
- [Keyboard](./keyboard.md)
- [Graphics](./graphics.md)
- [Errors](./errors.md)

These utilities are used throughout the openDAW applications and are kept
lightweight with no external runtime dependencies.
