# Learning Hub

The learning hub gathers tutorials and background material for openDAW.
Start with **[DAW Basics 101](./daw-basics-101.md)** to learn core concepts
like tracks, the mixer, and automation. Lessons build on each other, so work
through them in order or jump to topics using the sidebar.

## Lessons

- [Audio Effects and Signal Chain](./lessons/audio-effects-and-signal-chain.md)
- [MIDI and Synthesis](./lessons/midi-and-synthesis.md)
- [Latency and Buffers](./how-it-works/latency-and-buffers.md)
- [Storage Model](./how-it-works/storage-model.md)

Each page includes links to the next step so you can follow a continuous
learning path or explore individual subjects as needed.
