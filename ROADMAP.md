# openDAW Roadmap

## Pipeline Overview

Turbo coordinates workspace tasks such as builds, tests, and documentation
generation, while Lerna handles package versioning and publishing. Deployment
configs for Vercel and Netlify document how releases will be delivered.

## Near term

- Publish core documentation set and initial diagrams.
- Define documentation ownership and review process.
- Run continuous integration for tests and linting.

## Mid term

- Launch internationalization workflow for community translations.
- Integrate accessibility tooling and audits.
- Version documentation alongside the first stable release.

## Long term

- Support additional languages and downloadable offline docs.
- Provide real-time collaborative editing for documentation.
- Evolve roadmap based on community feedback.

Roadmap items are tentative and may change as the project evolves.
