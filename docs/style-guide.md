# Documentation Style Guide

This guide establishes conventions for writing and maintaining openDAW documentation.

## Voice and tone

- Use friendly, inclusive language.
- Write in present tense and active voice.
- Prefer short sentences and simple words.

## Formatting

- Structure pages with incremental Markdown headings.
- Use sentence case for headings.
- Wrap code and commands in backticks.
- Provide alt text for all images.
- Link to other docs using relative paths.

## Review cadence

- Pages owned by active teams are reviewed **monthly**.
- The entire documentation set is audited **quarterly** for accuracy and broken links.
- Page owners listed in `ownership-map.md` drive reviews and updates.

## Versioning strategy

- Documentation follows the projectâ€™s release tags.
- `main` reflects work for the next release; stable versions are tagged and stored under `versioned_docs/`.
- Deprecated pages are archived rather than deleted to preserve history.
