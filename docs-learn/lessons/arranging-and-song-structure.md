# Arranging & Song Structure

Arranging organizes musical ideas into a complete song. openDAW's timeline helps you build sections and move parts around.

## Hands-on: Build an Arrangement

1. **Sketch a loop** – Create a short loop for drums, bass or chords in the timeline.
2. **Duplicate to extend** – Select the loop and use copy/paste or drag to duplicate it across the timeline.
3. **Define sections** – Mark out intro, verse and chorus by arranging clips or adding empty space.
4. **Add variation** – Modify MIDI notes, swap instrument presets or mute elements to create contrast between sections.
5. **Use markers** – Place timeline markers to label each part of the song for easy navigation.
6. **Create transitions** – Add fills, risers or automation to lead the listener between sections.
7. **Finalize the structure** – Trim the project end point and export your song when satisfied.

By iterating through these steps you can transform simple loops into a structured piece of music.
