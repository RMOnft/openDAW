# Mixing & Panning

Mixing balances levels and places sounds within the stereo field. openDAW's mixer provides straightforward controls for both.

## Hands-on: Balance a Simple Mix

1. **Load a multitrack project** – Open a project with at least a few tracks or duplicate an existing one.
2. **Open the Mixer** – Use the mixer view to see faders and pan knobs for every track.
3. **Set initial levels** – Play the song and move each track's fader so that no channel or the master meter clips.
4. **Pan tracks** – Turn the pan knob left or right to give instruments their own space. Try panning drums slightly left and guitars right.
5. **Create a sense of space** – Use send effects like reverb or delay to add depth while keeping levels under control.
6. **Check the mix** – Toggle solo and mute buttons to focus on individual parts, ensuring each element is clear.
7. **Compare on headphones and speakers** – Listening on different systems helps you judge balance and stereo placement.

These basic steps demonstrate how thoughtful level and pan adjustments can create a cohesive stereo mix.
