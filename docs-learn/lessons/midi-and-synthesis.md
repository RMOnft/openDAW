# MIDI & Synthesis

MIDI describes musical events, while synthesis turns those events into sound. In openDAW you can explore both concepts interactively.

## Hands-on: Program a Synth Melody

1. **Create a MIDI track** – In the track list choose _Add Track → Instrument_. An empty instrument track appears.
2. **Add a synthesizer** – Open the Device Panel for the new track and load a built‑in synth such as _Simple Synth_.
3. **Draw a MIDI clip** – In the timeline drag to create a region, then double‑click it to open the piano roll.
4. **Enter notes** – Click within the piano roll to place a few notes. Press _Space_ to hear them.
5. **Shape the sound** – Adjust oscillator waveforms, filter cutoff and envelope controls in the synth UI. Listen to how the tone changes.
6. **Experiment further** – Change note lengths, velocities or instrument presets to explore how MIDI data affects synthesis.

By sending MIDI messages to a synth and tweaking its parameters you build an intuitive understanding of how electronic instruments create sound.
