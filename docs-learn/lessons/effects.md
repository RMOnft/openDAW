# Effects

Effects process audio to shape tone and space. openDAW lets you stack effects or route tracks to shared processors.

## Hands-on: Build an Effect Chain

1. **Prepare a sound source** – Use an existing track or create a new instrument track with a simple pattern.
2. **Open the Device Panel** – Select the track and open its Device Panel to manage processors.
3. **Insert an effect** – Click _Add Device_ and choose an effect like _Delay_ or _Reverb_. The effect appears after the instrument.
4. **Tweak parameters** – Adjust sliders or knobs on the effect to hear how the sound changes.
5. **Add another effect** – Insert an _EQ_ or _Compressor_ after the first effect to build a chain.
6. **Use send effects** – Create a new _Aux_ track with a _Reverb_ and use each track's _Send_ knob to route audio to it.
7. **Save your chain** – Once you like the sound, save the track or effect chain as a preset for reuse.

Experimenting with different effect orders and settings reveals how signal processing shapes a mix.
